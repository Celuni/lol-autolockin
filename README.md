# lol-autolockin
Simple script that auto locks in the selected champion in Draft mode like it does on Clash or Blind.

This should only be used as a failsafe in case that you can't always lock in through the client.

## Installation

* Install a 3.7+ version of Python.

* Clone the repository in a folder.

* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

* Finally, run `python main.py`.

    * To log all the client requests, include the `--debug` argument when launching the program.
